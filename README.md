## 📋 Requirements

This project is a fork of [HakuNeko](https://github.com/manga-download/haruneko) - the original manga downloader desktop application. The core manga scraping engine and 788+ website scrapers are from HakuNeko, with an added REST API layer to enable programmatic access and integration.

### Download Fails

1. Check source is still active: `GET /api/v1/sources/{sourceId}`
2. Verify chapter IDs are correct
3. Check logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure sufficient disk space in `storage/` directory
